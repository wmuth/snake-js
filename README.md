# snake-js
A project I did for a programming class a few years back.

## How to play the game.
1. Download the files and open snake.html in your browser.
2. Press the start button.
3. Change your snake's direction using the arrow keys to eat the red food blocks.

## Rules
- You see your score underneath the start button, every 5 food you eat you gain a level.
- The levels increase difficulty by making the snake faster and eventually spawning yellow obstacles you have to avoid.
- Every few levels your snake will turn into a rainbow changing colours, at that point you can eat the obstacles to clear the stage somewhat.
- If you hit the side of the map, you lose.
- You can pause the game at any point.
